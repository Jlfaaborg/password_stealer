Steals Passwords

It doesnt actually but it is a Full Stack application using some technologies such as:
React, Express, Redux, Typescript, MYSQL.

MUST HAVE NODE: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

To Run from root directory in terminal
  "npm install"
  "npm run start"
  
  From there on just "npm run start" to start. Or update a file and save while running to reload.

Pretty much all this does is asks for a username and password and stores it in a database. You can add multiple Users to the redux store which changes how the table will render. You can also fetch Users from the db post Users to the db. All fetch requests will add to the state all post requests will post the state to the db

ENJOY!
